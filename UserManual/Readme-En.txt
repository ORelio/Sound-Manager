Thanks for downloading SoundManager!

SoundManager is a free software allowing to easily create and share Windows sound schemes.
All Windows versions from Windows XP SP3 to Windows 11 are supported.

Main features are the following:
 - Load and test sound files for each event
 - Define metadata such as thumbnail, author, description
 - Export and import sound schemes using archive files
 - Import sound schemes created with the Sound applet
 - Auto-convert sounds to WAV format (Windows 7+)
 - Patch Windows Vista/7 startup sound (Admin required)
 - Play startup/shutdown sounds on Windows 8 and greater
 - Load proprietary "soundpack" archive files

============
 How to use
============

Setup (if using the standalone version):
 - Extract the archive in a fixed place such as C:\Program Files\SoundManager or Documents\SoundManager
 - Run SoundManager.exe, go to Settings and enable the desired features under System integration
 - Optionally create a Desktop shortcut for SoundManager.exe ;)

Uninstall (if using the standalone version):
 - Run SoundManager.exe, go to Settings and click Uninstall under Maintenance section
 - Delete the SoundManager directory, such as C:\Program Files\SoundManager or Documents\SoundManager
 - Optionally delete the previously created Desktop shortcut

Create a sound scheme
 - Prepare sound files, preferably in WAV format, using an audio editor such as Audacity
 - It is recommended to have a consistent loudness between all your audio files
 - Load a sound scheme or click Reset to start from the system sound scheme
 - Change sounds using Drag & Drop or right click > Replace
 - Set metadata such as image, name, author and description
 - Click Export when you are satisfied with the result :)
